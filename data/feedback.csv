Even small disruptions sometimes trigger a lot of anxiety for me","When plans change unexpectedly, I start feeling tense and panicked. I usually overthink the new situation and struggle to adjust. I try deep breathing or isolating myself to cope, but it doesn't always help.","Crowded or noisy places right after a change make it worse. I’ve tried journaling and using calming music, which sometimes helps, but avoidance often feels like the easiest option in the moment",,Anxiety,99.4

hi,"I've been feeling very anxious and unsettled, like I constantly have to check or fix things","Yes, I’ve started washing my hands repeatedly and double-checking locks more than usual",I'm constantly worried something bad will happen if I don’t follow certain routines or do things a specific number of times,Not really. I feel embarrassed if I’m caught repeating behaviors like rechecking or arranging things,I stay up late because I need to repeatedly check if I've turned off the stove or locked the doors,"Yes, my mind keeps going back to whether I’ve done things correctly or not","Definitely. I have to arrange objects in a certain way or repeat actions until they feel “right.""","Yes, it’s hard to talk about my compulsions because I fear people won’t understand.","Not much. My anxiety mostly revolves around order, cleanliness, and fears of harm","Very. If I can’t follow my usual checking routines, I feel extremely uneasy and panicked","Yes, I’ve noticed that my need to check things gets much worse when I feel stressed or uncertain—especially around tasks like locking the door, turning off appliances, or sending emails. I often feel like if I don’t repeat these actions several times, something bad might happen. It’s not just a habit—it feels like an urgent need.  I haven’t spoken with a professional yet, mostly because I wasn’t sure if this was something serious, but it’s been affecting my daily routine and peace of mind for quite some time now","Thank you for sharing your experiences with me. To help clarify your symptoms and better understand what you're going through, could you tell me if you have noticed any difficulties in social interactions or communication, any specific repetitive behaviors or interests that significantly occupy your time, or any sensitivity to sensory input, such as lights, sounds, or textures? These can also be important aspects to consider alongside the anxiety and compulsive behaviors you've described","I don’t usually have issues communicating or interacting with others, but I do find myself caught in repetitive behaviors like checking and organizing things a certain way. For example, I often need to tap objects or repeat phrases in my head to ease anxiety. These routines can take up a significant part of my day.  As for sensory input, I can get slightly overwhelmed by loud or sudden noises, but it’s mostly my thoughts and compulsions that drive my stress. I spend a lot of time trying to neutralize the “what if” thoughts that won’t go away unless I do something specific",,Autism,85.06
